# Description

I use this script when searching for apartments for rent in Vancouver. It allows for filtering of initial search conditions, such as price and area, and exports the results to a Notion notebook.<br>
I use Notion to keep track of the status of my actions related to the apartments I am interested in. I create a page in a Notion database for each apartment, and use the database to track the status of my actions such as scheduling a viewing or submitting an application.

# Intention

1. Export the information to notion for easy comparison, and organize the details of each apartment in the table format.
1. Do a initial filtering of apartment base on some predefined condition
